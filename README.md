## 🧠 Summary

I specialize in designing and operating scalable backend systems and cloud infrastructure with a strong DevOps mindset.

development and CI/CD to deployment, monitoring, and release execution.

I have consistently reduced deployment times, improved system reliability, and supported multi-team onboarding through
clean architecture and robust platform practices.
